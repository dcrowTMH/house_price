# Kaggle_house_price
Purpose for this notebook: Learn from the professional user in kaggle

This notebook is aimed to demostrate how Kaggle's expert work on the EDA about the house price data set. 

I just follow how the editor(DOMINIK GAWLIK) analyse the data step by step and

add some code with my idea to improve it.

Data set used: House Pirce

Reference: https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/house-prices-eda/notebook

# Note for dimension reduction
Found some other theory related to dimension reduction after applying PCA into the data set instead of just following the editor

It will be used for marking note & try to demostrate some code from the others or some new data set
